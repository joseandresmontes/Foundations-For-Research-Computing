### Workshop Description

Surveys are an essential tool used across various disciplines in sampling and drawing inferences from populations of interest. However, poor survey design, survey tool limitations or data reliability and validation issues can lead to lengthy and often costly analysis of survey data.

This two-hour online workshop aims to introduce individuals looking to conduct or work with survey data with best practices in survey research and how to overcome common issues in survey design and data integrity. Participants will learn concepts such as survey measurement methods, data invalidity identification techniques and basic data transformations (log, square etc.). This workshop will present these concepts through an example and culminate with preliminary insights drawn from a survey. After the workshop, participating researchers will be better prepared in conducting surveys and handling survey data in addition to havng a basic understanding of the Qualtrics survey platform.

### Requirements and Workshop Goals

#### Requirements

Basic knowledge of statistics on the level of an introductory level course is assumed. The focus is on survey methodology, but some statistical concepts will appear.

The course uses the software package `R` for the whole workshop. The program `R` itself can be downloaded for free at <http://cran.r-project.org/>. Intermediate familiarity with the software, in particular with regards to importing, cleaning, and reshaping data is assumed. Knowledge of specific packages and other software tools will be built throughout the workshop.

You will need to have access to your own computer to install and follow the exercise. I highly recommend having access to qualtrics or some familiarity with the tool since an overview of it will be carried out. Using some of the resources noted in the next References and Resources sections will be more than enough to be able to cover material in workshop.

#### Workshop Goals

1.  Achieve a basic understanding of survey research, management and preliminary analysis

2.  Have an understanding of Qualtrics workflow and how to transfer data into R

3.  Parameterizing report for multiple organizations (if enough time)

### Policies

**Open but Respectful environment**

This workshop targets a broad base of students/practitioners. Everyone is encouraged to ask question as they arise and others are expected to not interrupt, interject or engage in condescending behavior or other behavior that is not conducive to a learning environment. Failure to abide to such policy will result in offender being asked to exit out of the workshop or be blocked for the remainder of the workshop.

**Make Every Minute Count**

While you are not expected to turn off or silence your cell phones prior or during the workshop, it would be of the greatest benefit for everyone if there is engagement in the workshop. I might provide short answers as I try to finish the material scheduled for the workshop, but make sure to ask for more details after the workshop (or email me).

Workshop slides and exercises will be made available on github [here](https://github.com/joseandresmontes?tab=repositories). 
So do not worry about missing certain details and focus on the workshop so you can ask questions.
